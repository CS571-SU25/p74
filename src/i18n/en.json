  "about.title": "About Aimyong",
  "about.desc": "Aimyon (born March 6, 1995, in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo Prefecture) is a Japanese singer-songwriter. Raised in a musical family, she began writing lyrics and playing acoustic guitar in her second year of middle school, gaining attention at school and local events for her candid storytelling and warm vocal tone.\n\nAfter debuting with the indie single Anata Kaibō Jun'ai-ka Shine exclusively at Tower Records in 2015, she made her major debut in November 2016 with Ikite Itanda Yona on the Unborde label. The song was featured as a drama theme and introduced her to audiences across Japan.",
  "about.songs": "Her breakthrough hit Marigold (2018) topped streaming charts for 20 consecutive weeks and solidified her reputation in the digital era. She performed on NHK's prestigious Kōhaku Uta Gassen that same year and has since contributed theme songs to animated films and toured arenas both in Japan and abroad.\n\nAimyon's style blends J-pop with folk and rock influences, drawing inspiration from '80s and '90s Japanese singer-songwriters such as Spitz, Shōgo Hamada, and Takuro Yoshida. Her concise yet powerful lyrics paired with clear guitar sounds showcase a signature sensibility that has earned her status as one of today's most promising music icons.",
